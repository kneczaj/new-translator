<p><span class="font0">Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said his government identified all the extra budget cuts needed to reduce state spending by 325 million euros ($427 million) as </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">agreed</span><span class="font0"> with the country’s international creditors to secure a second aid package.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The government identified “a series of additional measures amounting to 125 million euros in order to complete the package of budget cuts worth 325 million euros,” Papademos told ministers at a meeting of the Greek Cabinet in Athens today, according to an e-mailed transcript, of his comments from his office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The me</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">asure</span><span class="font0">s, which were agreed in principle with the International Monetary Fund, the European union and the European Central Bank will lead to a permanent cut in government spending and so to a reduction in Greece’s </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">budget</span><span class="font0"> deficit, Papademos said. The measures will be presented to a meeting of euro-area finance ministers on Feb.20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Papademos said that </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">whil</span><span class="font0">e a cut to j)ejasions could not be </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">avoided</span><span class="font0">, the impact is “‘milder’’ than what it appears. For someone who receives a pension of 1,500 euros, there will be a reduction of 12 percent above 1,300 euros leading to a cut of 24 euros.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Greece’s 20-billion euro Helios project to produce electricity from solar energy for export will lead to substantially increased investment and help the country to repay debt, Papademos said.</span></p>
